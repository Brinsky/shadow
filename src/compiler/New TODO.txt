Fix it so that it is impossible to add two classes with the same fully qualified path:

package shadow.standard;
class String {}

package shadow.standard;
class String {}

***************
Local methods
***************

Look just like regular methods, except no public, private, or protected.
Can include local variables, but those variables must be final.
Can include member variables.
Cannot be created anonymously. (This could change, but there is no good syntax, it seems.)

x (int) => (int, int)
{

}

Should class names always be separated with colons?
How do you instance an inner singleton?

Singletons should not be accessible inside of constructors, for leakage reasons. <== does that matter?
