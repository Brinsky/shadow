*** PUT YOUR NAME NEXT TO SOMETHING IF YOU'RE WORKING ON IT               ***
*** DELETE THE LINE FROM THE LIST IF IT'S DONE AND WORKING                ***

=> PARSING <=
- FIX: There is an issue with the GT token stuff. The following doesn't parse: if(a > b)

- Add the weak keyword
- Add error: no methods allowed
- Add sequences (need a better name?), i.e. x,y,z = 3, z, 4;

=> TYPE CHECKING <=
- Add checking for assignments
- Add checking for operators: + - etc
- Add checking for method calls
- Include checking with literals for all of the above
- Add subtyping rules

- Improve scoping so that we don't just return the first symbol we actually get the correct one
