=> PARSING <=
- Add error (Errors are like exceptions except uncatchable and cannot have public methods)
- Should string be listed as a primitive type when its semantics will always be reference style?
- Check literals to see if they can be divided into double and float, int and long, etc.

=> TYPE CHECKING <=
- Add checking for assignments
- Add checking for operators: + - etc
- Add checking for method calls
- Include checking with literals for all of the above
- Add subtyping rules

- Improve scoping so that we don't just return the first symbol we actually get the correct one
