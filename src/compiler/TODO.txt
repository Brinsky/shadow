*** PUT YOUR NAME NEXT TO SOMETHING IF YOU'RE WORKING ON IT               ***
*** DELETE THE LINE FROM THE LIST IF IT'S DONE AND WORKING                ***

- Remove do { } while() loops (Barry) ???

- Add the #= <<<= >>>= <<< >>> operators to the language
  - NOTE: <<< and >>> will have to use the GT stuff... however that works?
- Add the weak keyword
- Add error: no methods allowed
- Add sequences (need a better name?), i.e. x,y,z = 3, z, 4;
